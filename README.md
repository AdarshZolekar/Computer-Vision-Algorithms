# Computer Vision Nanodegree Udacity

These are several projects I developed as a part of
  [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program.](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)
  
# Projects 
  Your can view and launch the following Python projects:
  
[Fast detector of facial keypoints (ORB)](https://github.com/Rafael1s/Computer-Vision-Udacity/tree/master/Agorithm-ORB)

[Hough transform to detect straigt lines](https://github.com/Rafael1s/Computer-Vision-Udacity/tree/master/Algorithm-HoughTransform) 

[Find contours and their directions](https://github.com/Rafael1s/Computer-Vision-Udacity/tree/master/Find-Contours)

[AdaBoost frontal face detector](https://github.com/Rafael1s/Computer-Vision-Udacity/tree/master/Haar-Cascades)

# Environment

Make sure that Python and libraries numpy, cv2, matplotlab  are installed.
You can find the additional info about every project in the corresponding README file.
