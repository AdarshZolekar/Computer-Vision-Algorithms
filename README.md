## Computer Vision Nanodegree Udacity

Here you can find several small (and slightly larger) subprojects dedicated to the well-known 
Computer Vision approaches and algorithms. These subprojects are developed as part of the 
[**_Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program_**](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).  
Several projects are devoted to [**_Deep Learning Arcitecture_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) of [**_Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and [**_Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network):

* _FashionMNIST Convolution Network_
* _YOLOv3 notebook implementation_
* _CharacterLevel RNN with LSTM_
* _Facial Key Points CNN (Project 1)_
* _Image Captioning CNN+RNN (Project 2)_

### Credit  

I liked the course "Computer Vision Nanodegree".    
Many thanks to Udacity for the high learning standards.   
Most of the code in this repository is based on Udacity code.
