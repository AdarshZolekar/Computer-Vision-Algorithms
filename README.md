# Computer Vision Nanodegree Udacity

Here you can find several small (and slightly larger) subprojects dedicated 

to the well-known Computer Vision approaches and algorithms. These subprojects 

are developed as part of the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree course.](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)
