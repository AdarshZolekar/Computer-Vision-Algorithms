    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture consits of a CNN encoder and RNN decoder. The CNN encoder is the [50-layer Resnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) model that is a good pre-trained convolutional neural network on ImageNet. The network serves as a feature encoder for images to be captioned. The last fully connected layer of encoder is dropped and replaced by a new fully connected layer transforming the final feature map to an encoding. This encoded feature map is the input for the RNN decoder. Reccurent neural network (RNN) is useful in the tasks with sequential nature of data such as machine translation or speach recognition. Usually the RNN network stores only some last states of the network (for example, three last words in the text sentence or speech). The RNN network can include the advanced and sophisticated component, the layer with long memory proposed in 1997 by [S.Hochreiter and J.Schmidhuber](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735). This layer is called [Long short-term memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). We first use the CNN encoder output concatenated with the \"START\" token as the initial input for the RNN decoder. In the RNN decoder, we prepare the tensor from incoming feature map and captions. This tensor together with hidden state is the input for the LSTM layer. We apply a fully-connected layer to derive a softmax probability. The word with the highest probability in our entire vocabulary is the the predicted word. Then, this predicted word become the input for the next prediction. We continue so until the network generated the \"STOP\" token, which is the end of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "( We continue so until we generated a caption of max length, or the network generated the \"STOP\" token, which is the end of the sentence.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the hyperparameters I consulted with papers [\"Show, Attend and Tell\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf), [\"Empirical Exploration of RNN\"](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf), and I also tested several models with different sets of hyperparameters. Two criteria were used to select a set of hyperparameters:\n",
    "  * the least value of the \"_loss_\" function, \n",
    "  * visualization of several images with the predicted captions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the following parameters (in bold) are selected:\n",
    "  * batch_size = **128** # tried also 32, 64, 128, 256,   \n",
    "  * vocab_threshold = **4** # tried also 5,6,         \n",
    "  * embed_size = **256** # tried also 512,           \n",
    "  * lr = **0.001**, # tried also 0.001, 0.005,                        \n",
    "  * criterion = **CrossEntropyLoss**, \n",
    "  * optimizer = **Adam** # tried also ASGD, Adagrad.\n",
    "      \n",
    "The num_epochs = 3 and hidden_size = 512 are selected as recommended by Udacity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "In [Resnet, Ch.3.4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), in one of implementations,\n",
    "a 224x224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its horizontal flip,  and the image \n",
    "is resized such that the shorter side is 256.\n",
    "Thus, the provided transform in `transform_train` is mainly adhere to the Resnet architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  All RNN decoder weights are selected for training. The Resnet-50 network is a good pre-trained CNN network, so it makes no sense to include the parameters of this network for training. The exception is the new embedded layer used to transform the CNN feature map into the RNN decoder input. Thus, it makes sense to train the weights of this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As noted in the [\"AlgoritmiA\" blog](https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-optimizers/), the Adam optimizer is quite widespread and accepted for use in training neural networks. There are [examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08292) \n",
    "where adaptive gradient methods, in particular, the Adam optimizer gives worse results than the SGD optimizer.\n",
    "I tested several optimizers on my local machine: Adam, ASGD, Adagrad. In all cases, the model with Adam optimizer gives significantly better values for the “loss” function."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
